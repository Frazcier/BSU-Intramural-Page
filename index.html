                                It was the championship game, and the score was tied. Five seconds left. The pressure was intense. The school’s star player wiped his sweat dramatically. The crowd held their breath.<br>
                                And then—BOOM.<br>
                                The ball was stolen. By whom? By <i>Kyle</i> , the team’s <i>water boy</i>.<br>
                                Nobody knew why he was on the court. Not even Kyle. But somehow, he was dribbling down the court with the grace of a newborn giraffe. The other team hesitated—was this allowed? Did Kyle even <i>go</i> to this school?<br>
                                But Kyle? Kyle didn’t care. He yeeted the ball from half-court with the confidence of a man who had <em>never</em> played basketball in his life.<br>
                                The buzzer rang.<br>
                                Swish.<br>
                                Game over.<br>
                                Kyle was lifted onto the shoulders of the team, screaming, <q><b>I HAVE ASCENDED.</b></q> Nobody ever questioned it.

                                The 4x100m relay was going smoothly—until <i>Tim</i> got the baton.<br>
                                Tim, bless his soul, had the coordination of a spoon in a blender. The moment he started running, his foot <i>betrayed</i> him. He tripped, sending the baton flying into the air. The crowd gasped.<br>
                                But fate had other plans.<br>
                                The baton bounced off a referee’s head, ricocheted off the scoreboard, smacked a bird mid-flight, and <i>landed perfectly</i> in the hands of the final runner.<br>
                                With no time to process what just happened, the runner sprinted to the finish line, securing first place.<br>
                                Tim, still lying face-down on the track, raised a shaky thumbs-up. <q><b>Totally planned that.</b></q>

                                Ben did not want to be here. He had signed up for chess club, yet somehow, he was standing on the dodgeball court, facing off against the school’s most athletic students.<br>
                                His game plan? <b>Survive</b>.<br>
                                The first ball came flying—he tripped, dodging it. The second ball—he bent down to tie his shoe, and it <i>barely</i> missed him.<br>
                                At this point, the crowd was <i>screaming</i>.<br>
                                The other team was getting frustrated. They launched <i>five</i> balls at him at once. Ben <i>sneezed</i>—and all <i>five missed</i>.<br>
                                Then, by some miracle (or cruel joke from the universe), the final ball bounced off the ceiling, hit the last three opponents, and eliminated them all.<br>
                                Ben had won. Without throwing a single ball.<br>
                                His team erupted into cheers. The coach stared at him in pure awe.<br>
                                Ben adjusted his glasses. <q><b>Skill issue.</b></q>

                    <p class="news-content">What was supposed to be a tense overtime battle ended in the most unexpected way—when a substitute player, who hadn’t touched the ball all game, accidentally scored the winning shot while tying his shoe. “I was just trying to fix my laces,” he said, now forever known as the "Lucky Laces Legend."</p>

                    <p class="news-content">The volleyball finals had a shocking twist—not because of an incredible spike, but because the leading team forgot they needed one more point to win. After celebrating too early, they let their guard down, and their opponents casually served their way to victory. "We thought we won… turns out, we just lost harder," said a disappointed player.</p>
